# Sales-Analysis-1
We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

. Drop NaN values from DataFrame

. Removing rows based on a condition

. Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

. Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

1- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

2- What city sold the most product?

3- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?

4- What products are most often sold together?

5- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:


. Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)

. Adding columns

. Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)

. Using the .apply() method

. Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis

. Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results

. Labeling our graphs
